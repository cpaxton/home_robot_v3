## OVMM agentic find — PR #110 / #111 follow-ups (validated 2026-08-11)

Context: teleport-mode OVMM find on the shared AgenticEQA loop. PR #110 fixes nav
(sample_target_point projection, chunked-nav-as-progress); PR #111 (stacked) adds the
`NavOutcome` enum + question-type-aware verification + camera diagnostic. What's left:

- [ ] **Recep loop explores away from the target, never converges.** "Where is the table?"
      runs all 8 rounds with `nav=0..2 explore=N`; the router keeps picking
      explore_frontier and the assess returns not-present (table not in those views).
      Obj loop now verifies in 2 rounds, so the verify gate + camera are fine — this is a
      **targeting/search problem**. Next steps:
  - [ ] Debug why investigate cards for "table" are absent/ranked low: `hypothesize_nav_targets`
        (graph_memory.py:2689) recall for receptacle labels; dump the card list the router saw
        (`_investigate_hypotheses` at agentic_eqa.py:1015) per recep round.
  - [ ] Check `_prefer_explore` / `_not_present_streak` / `_update_escape_streak` loop: close-look
        ABSENT nudges explore (agentic_eqa.py:2593), which may pull the robot away from the start
        table instead of toward it. Add an investigate bias when the question target is near the
        robot's start receptable.
  - [ ] Consider a distance-gated investigate fallback: if a place card is within `X` m and
        unvisited, prefer `investigate` over `explore_frontier` even when the router leans explore.
- [ ] **Open-question verification semantics are now present-only** (agentic_eqa.py:2441 `open_view_present`).
      Confirm this doesn't over-trust a single glance for location questions where the target is
      visible but mis-localized — verify the verified-obs XYZ error distribution in the next
      full OVMM run (teleport) against GT.
- [ ] **Full teleport OVMM find validation run** (all 9 episodes, `EMET_SIM_NAV_TELEPORT=1`) on
      `feat/nav-outcome-enum` after the recep-targeting fix: want find_object + find_recep rates
      vs the real-physics baseline (1/3 obj, 1/6 recep) and the pre-fix teleport run (1/9 obj, 0/9 recep).
- [ ] **Camera diagnostic** `scripts/debug_ovmm_camera_quality.py`: confirmed no all-black frames
      (mean≈122, std≈93, black_frac=0). Depth stream reads 0 because the diagnostic client is built
      with `allow_missing_depth`; for a true blocked-camera depth check, request depth on the client
      (drop `allow_missing_depth` or set `EMET_ZMQ_FULL_HZ` depth track). Ray trace (`mj_ray`) needs
      model/data on the client — either expose it or run the ray check inside the sim server process.
- [ ] **Slowness**: teleport base nav is ~4s/step (vs ~50s real physics) but each episode is still
      ~30-50 min because (a) every investigate does a full 4-pan head sweep (~40-80s) and (b) two
      agentic loops per episode (obj + recep). Options: `_fast_explore_lookaround` (2-pan) in the
      OVMM find path like run_dynagraph does, and cap recep rounds when the recep is the start
      receptable (already known).
- [ ] **NavOutcome propagation**: `nav_outcome` is recorded in the agentic trace but not yet in
      `NavAttemptResult` consumers (graph_memory `record_nav_attempt`, router state message). Expose
      the enum string in the router "Recent actions" so the VLM can see reached-vs-progress-vs-blocked.

## Prompt / information flow

- [x] **One fact, one line — de-duplicate EQA memory blocks**: folded CONFIRMED_MEMORY → SCENE_GRAPH is now the **default** (`eqa.merged_memory` on; env can flip). HM-EQA paper row pins `merged_memory: false` in `configs/benchmarks/dynagraph.yaml` to keep published numbers on the standalone block. IMAGE_DESCRIPTIONS (when enabled) omit labels already tagged on SCENE_GRAPH Image-N lines.
- [x] **Room context never reaches the answer VLM**: done — `to_string` emits `Rooms:` + per-node `(room)` tags and `query_answer` passes them to the answer model.
- [x] **EQA answer format → JSON**: HM-EQA/MCQ use `{"reasoning","answer","confidence","action","confidence_reasoning"}` (`eqa.answer_format` / `EMET_EQA_ANSWER_FORMAT`; default json for hmeqa/mcq). `parse_answer` prefers JSON with labeled-field fallback; prefill is `{"reasoning":`.
- [x] **Unified token budget for the EQA prompt**: `eqa_vl.eqa_prompt_max_tokens` default 2500 (`EMET_EQA_PROMPT_MAX_TOKENS`); truncation order HISTORY → CONFIRMED_MEMORY → edges → labels via `build_eqa_prompt_text`.
- [ ] **Router prompt hygiene**: canonical/LLM format blocks in agentic_tools.py duplicate rules (investigate-vs-explore, in_target_area). Single source of truth + a unit test asserting `build_graph_eqa_system_prompt` byte-stability (prefix-KV cache depends on it).
- [x] **HISTORY loop risk**: HISTORY stores one-line outcomes (`Iter: answer=… conf=… action=… salvage=… | reason`) plus `Nav_result`, not raw model replays.
- [ ] **CHAT `_FORMAT_BLOCK` is ~90 lines of routing edge cases** (prompt.py): consider tiered prompt (short default; detailed hints appended only for 4B-class routers) and measure system-prompt chars/tokens with and without hints.
- [ ] **describe_scene grounding**: currently caption + optional graph labels appended ad hoc (`describe_head_camera_scene_text`, controller_dynamem.py:1049). Define one consistent grounding format shared with `query_scene_graph` so the chat VLM sees the same memory vocabulary as EQA.

## Embodied agent / Herman

- [x] **One open-vocab scene graph (not two builders)**: CHAT uses mutually exclusive `agent.memory_backend` (`dynagraph` | `graph_eqa` | `open_vocab` | `dynamem`). Discord presets → Dynagraph memory plug-in only; GraphEQA baseline left frozen for paper. Lifelong save/load writes the active plug-in only.
- [ ] **Arm IK “closer look”**: point the wrist / EE camera at a named object (or image region), then capture.
  - Stub tool today: `aim_arm_at` in chat pack (returns not-implemented + suggests `describe_scene`).
  - Needs: Mars/Stretch IK + wrist frame + safety (collision, joint limits); then `take_ee_picture` only *after* aim.
  - Until then: “closer look / inspect X” → **change viewpoint** (rotate / small drive) then `describe_scene` / `send_image` (head), never raw `take_ee_picture`.
- [x] **Chat verify ≈ EQA look**: prompt + tools route “look at / closer look / are you sure” → `face_toward` then `describe_scene` (not blind ±45°); tests in `test_agent_prompt_and_tools` / `test_face_toward`. Full EQA-style `navigate_to_obs` + `verify_siglip` in CHAT still optional later.
- [x] **`emet run` + `--connection`**: wrapper no longer injects default `--robot-ip 127.0.0.1`, so `--connection herman` resolves the profile host.
- [ ] **Interruptible explore**: Discord messages queue until `explore` finishes; drain `unified_input_queue` mid-nav.
- [ ] **VRAM for Discord house chat**: default Mars preset loads tool LLM + EQA 8B VL + SigLIP (+ DA3). Easy OOM on 24 GiB when map update / DA3 overlaps generate. Mitigations: `--onboard-da3`, share one VL (`--llm qwen3-vl-eqa --share-memory-vllm`), or lazy-unload captioner between turns. (Dual OV+GE builders removed; still watch two VLMs.)

## Mapping / safety

- [x] Map-clip `move_forward` (including 0.1 m); refuse when map empty/blank.
- [x] Empty cloud guard in `list_objects_in_an_image` (navigate crash).
- [x] Clearance-aware A* + abort on waypoint timeout (prefer open space; do not raise `dilate_obstacle_size` as the primary fix).

## Memory stack (voxel + graph) — review backlog

- [ ] **Drift correction / relocalization** (long real-world runs): voxel map is robot-start-relative with a fixed `grid_origin`; only `--refine-start` applies an SE(2) fudge at checkpoint load. Plan ICP / pose-graph correction against the voxel map or re-anchor graph nodes during operation.
- [ ] **Pin depth units per source + runtime assert**: `sensor_graph_builder.py:80` assumes meters (`scaling=1.0`) while `core/interfaces.py:196` defaults to `1e-3` (mm). Verify per source (Stretch d405, DA3, Habitat) and assert once at attach.
- [ ] **Robot self-filter lost in DynaMem `add()`**: `voxel_dynamem.py:1109` copies base `voxel.py:403` minus the URDF mesh self-filter — the robot may see itself on real hardware. Reintroduce or document why it is off.
- [ ] **Split `query_answer` + de-dup renumber/rebuild blocks**: `build_eqa_prompt_text` is extracted (#104); `query_answer` is still ~477 lines — still need `run_eqa_prompt(commands)` / `finalize_eqa_answer(parsed)`. The renumber+rebuild block in `maintain`/`_drop_nodes_near`/`absorb_object_node` is copy-pasted 5×.
- [ ] **Rooms as first-class nodes**: runtime `RoomCluster` + prompt `Rooms:` / `(room)` tags exist; still recompute every refresh. Persist room id / name / bounds on nodes and in `graph.json` exports.
- [ ] **Bound voxel memory growth**: `observations` never pruned, `semantic_memory` keeps every subsampled point, pickles dump everything. Trim frames + downsample old semantic points on a schedule.
- [ ] **Prefix-KV timeout leaves a live CUDA worker** (`qwen3_vl_client.py:549-569` raises while the generate thread keeps running): next generate can race. Serialize on a lock or hard-kill the worker.
- [ ] **Silent exception hygiene**: ~23 `except Exception` in graph_memory.py — at least `_logger.debug` with node/obs context. (Bare `except:` in `voxel_dynamem.list_objects_in_an_image` now logs and retries.)
- [x] **Dead code sweep**: removed unused `Qwen3VLClient = Qwen35VLClient` alias from `qwen_client.py` and discarded Candidate 1/2 comment blocks in `voxel_map_dynamem.py`. (`get_change_events` / `alternate_nav_target_for_failed_action` remain in use.)

## Docs / ops

- [x] Document Herman Discord happy path: `innate_mars_hardware.md` Discord section covers `EMET_BASE_ROTATE_ONLY` + `EMET_ALLOW_SDPA_ATTN` / flash-attn with a tethered copy-paste env recipe.

## Manipulation / MolmoSpaces + rby1 (PR #83 follow-ups)

Offline units + scripted table smokes exist; these are the remaining **real / integration** and product gaps.

### Config / agent path
- [x] **Wire `agent.manip_mode` / `manip_collision` / `manip_planner` into `DynamemTaskExecutor`**: `emet run agent` merges the finalized chat `agent:` section (YAML / `--set agent.manip_*`) into `parameters["agent"]` before executor init; `EMET_MANIP_*` env vars still win. (Manip-only top-level `agent:` blocks are now recognized as chat-agent sections by the loader.)
- [x] **Stretch MuJoCo pick/place default**: with visual-servo off, any sim advertising `sim_set_body_pose` takes **GT teleport** instead of AnyGrasp / agent grasp. Documented in AGENT_RUN / molmospaces / motion_planning (two manip_mode namespaces); unit coverage in `test_sim_manipulation.py` + visual-servo success propagation tests.
- [x] **Stretch / AnyGrasp `_pickup` / `_place` always return True**: `DynamemTaskExecutor` propagates `GraspObjectOperation.was_successful()` / `agent.manipulate` / `agent.place` bools into `_last_exec_ok`; declined confirmation returns False.

### Real tests (not yet green on every machine)
- [ ] **MolmoSpaces ithor + rby1** kinematic and teleport smokes when `.venv-molmospaces` + assets are warm (`scripted_sim_pick_place` / `scripted_molmo_grasp_mp` / `scripted_tamp_pick_place` with `--sim configs/sim/molmospaces_ithor_train_0.yaml`).
- [x] **Molmo kinematic approach frame**: fixed `_world_base_xyt` + place detach/`sim_set_body_pose`/verify-before-retract; bowl→microwave kinematic PASS (grasp_err≈0.027, place_err=0; 2026-08-03).
- [x] **OVMM full** episode `molmo_ithor_rby1_s2_bowl_pp` with `manip_mode=sim` (find + teleport pick/place) — reconfirmed 2026-08-03 post base-frame/place fixes.
- [ ] **Robocasa / Stretch** pick-place smoke with and without `--visual-servo` to lock the teleport-vs-servo behavior.
- [ ] **CI / overnight**: mark or gate the above under `RUN_MOLMOSPACES_TESTS` / sim markers so agents use `emet test --no-sim` for the offline pack only.

### Motion / grasp quality
- [ ] **IK orientation**: MuJoCo IK is **position-only**; Molmo grasp quats set approach standoff but are not enforced at the EE. Need orientation (or constrained) IK before claiming grasp fidelity.
- [ ] **Kinematic gripper cmd failures**: `_set_gripper` open/close now logs a warning on ZMQ/actuator errors but still continues (attach/detach is the real hold). Decide whether gripper failure should fail the grasp/place result before attach, or verify finger joints after cmd.
- [ ] **GT body / receptacle disambiguation**: teleport + kinematic still take first category substring match (`receps[0]` / object query). Prefer nearest-to-nav-`point` (or explicit `object_gt_body`) when multiple bowls/microwaves exist.
- [ ] **Voxel / AABB arm collision in live agent**: kinematic path supports `EMET_MANIP_COLLISION=voxel|aabb`; default is `none`. Dogfood on a cluttered Molmo scene and turn voxel on by default only if latency is OK.
- [ ] **Instance-memory `plan_to_frontier`**: still one-sample → one plan (often RRT). Dynamem explore already uses multi-goal A*; port the same top-K → `goals=` pattern if SVM/instance agents stay in use.

### Hardware / product
- [ ] **Real-robot manip** (Stretch / Mars): no GT `sim_set_body_pose` — keep visual-servo / AnyGrasp; add a no-LLM tool-sequence test that asserts we **do not** enter teleport when `is_simulation` is false.
- [ ] **`aim_arm_at` / EE look** (see Embodied agent above): still stub; needed for “closer look” after pick failures.
- [ ] **Paper figures**: keep regenerating `manip_figures` / chase-cam MP4s from scripted TAMP on the scene used in the paper; check in paths under `~/runs/emet/` only (not repo blobs).
