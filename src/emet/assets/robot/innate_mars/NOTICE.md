# Innate Mars (Maurice) MuJoCo assets

These meshes and `innate_mars.xml` are derived from the **Maurice** simulation package in Innate’s ROS workspace (`maurice_sim/mjcf/maurice.mjcf` and `maurice_sim/meshes/`).

## Modifications in this tree

- `meshdir` in the MJCF was changed from a developer-specific absolute path to `meshdir="meshes"` (relative to this directory).
- The ground-plane geom was renamed from `floor` to `maurice_floor` so the model can be merged with `scene_default.xml` without duplicate default geom names.
