# Innate Mars (Maurice) MuJoCo assets

These meshes and `innate_mars.xml` are derived from the **Maurice** simulation package in Innate’s ROS workspace (`maurice_sim/mjcf/maurice.mjcf` and `maurice_sim/meshes/`).

## Modifications in this tree

- `meshdir` in the MJCF was changed from a developer-specific absolute path to `meshdir="meshes"` (relative to this directory).
- The ground-plane geom was renamed from `floor` to `maurice_floor` so the model can be merged with `scene_default.xml` without duplicate default geom names.

## License

Confirm redistribution terms with Innate Robotics before publishing this repository or distributing these files. Upstream `package.xml` in some trees lists license as TODO.

## Alignment with reference URDF

Geometries and camera placements in ``innate_mars.xml`` were checked against ``maurice_sim/urdf/maurice.urdf`` (Innate Maurice package): head link + stereo camera positions, link2 offset (z), gripper finger origin (joint6), EE link, and arm camera link pose. The MJCF remains planar-base + velocity actuators for teleop-style sim (not identical joint limits to URDF).
